it is the most popular app store of Android apps. With the app economy revenues growing to 460 billion U.S dollars 
from the advertisements, In-App purchases, etc. and it is projected to grow exponentially in the next few years. 
This project is aimed to help brands, investors, entrepreneurs and app developers to gain insight into the global opportunities present in the app market. 
Using Data Mining concepts, the team predicts how different aspects of the app can be the reason behind its success and that can be measured in terms of number of downloads. 
One of the criteria for an application to be successful is determined based on number of downloads (Installs).

This project aims to analyze the Google Play Store Dataset, to gain insights about what attributes help in 
identifying the number of downloads for a particular app. This insight can help people capture business opportunity 
in the Android app market economy. Google Play Store Dataset is taken from Kaggle. 
Stakeholders can derive the number of installs based on the parameters they consider while launching an app on 
google play store.
