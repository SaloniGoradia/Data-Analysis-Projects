EDA and Predictions on COVID-19 data set.

COVID-19 is an acute respiratory disease that has been classified as a pandemic by the World Health Organization. Characterization of this disease is still in its early stages; however, it is known to have high mortality rates, particularly among individuals with preexisting medical conditions. Creating data science models to identify and analyze the trends can provide great help to authorities to take precautionary steps and help those who are at the greatest risk for severe complications due to COVID-19 and help mitigate the diseaseâ€™s worst effect.
This project provides detailed insights on corona virus spread across the world. Exploratory data analysis on confirmed cases and death cases in the United States of America (USA) is studied. It was observed that the origin country China is not as impacted as another countries like Spain, Italy, United Kingdom, and the United States of America. The USA has highest number of Confirmed (32% of total confirmed cases worldwide) and Active cases (41% of total active cases worldwide). Furthermore, this report predicts coronavirus spread by optimizing the parameters of deep learning algorithms on the reliable source of datasets. Different models such as moving average, SIR (Susceptible, Infectious, and Recovered) model, prophet, Auto Regression Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), and neural network analysis are built to forecast the number of confirmed cases and deaths over the world for next 10 days. Prediction implies that confirmed cases would increase up to 3.6 million and fatalities would reach up to 270k across the world in next 10 days (starting from Apr 24, 2020).
To analyze the pandemic, a coronavirus dataset is imported from multiple Data Repositories by Johns Hopkins CSSE (Center for Systems Science and Engineering). This dataset is updated on a daily basis by Johns Hopkins CSSE. https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19
