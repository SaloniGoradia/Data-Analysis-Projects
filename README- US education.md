U.S. Census Bureau and the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) continuously collect data around 
multiple facets of the education system in schools across the U.S. including expenses, resources spent, student 
performance and enrollments among other things. The dataset for this project consists of two main categories of 
information: First about the financials including revenue and expenditure (by state & year) and the second being 
the number of enrolled students and their performance in different grades (math & reading).

With this project, the aim is to understand the patterns in the expenditures/revenue (per pupil) throughout 
the last 15 years using data visualization tools. Patterns in enrollments as well as average math & reading scores 
for students of grade 4 and grade 8 state wise are also investigated. Further, a detailed analysis into factors 
affecting studentsâ€™ performance in Grade 4 (for Math) has also been done through various machine-learning methods: 
linear regression, logistic regression, and classification tree.
